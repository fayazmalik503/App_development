Kiwi Framework is used for creating app, using kiwi you can
create app for windows, linux and Apple.
such as java flutter is important to know for buildinng java apps.
same as this for python you only way has Kivy framework to.

In this I created App using Kiwi framework however key can not be installed directly from pycharm so need to look for it
The below method worked for me.

The difficult part of this project was installing kiwi and you will have issue that will be this:
Modules You need to install

1. "I tried to install kivy but failed many times then I found this link and run in command line which later worked for me"
command for installation:
- pip install kivy[base] kivy_examples --pre --extra-index-url https://kivy.org/downloads/simple/
= copy this command and pest on command prompt and hit enter then your kivy install successfully in python any version.
2. then I installed KivyMD 0.104.2


Change the file from .py to .apk to use it in mobile phone
